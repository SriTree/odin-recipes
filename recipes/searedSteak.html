    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This chuck steak cuts like a ribeye. <strong>Seared</strong> in a hot skillet, then rested while you prepare a quick and easy pan sauce, this steak is tender and delicious. Serve it steakhouse-style, with <em>roasted potatoes, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms</em>.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) beef chuck steaks, well trimmed, at room temperature</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme (optional)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat steaks dry with a paper towel. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Place steaks in the hot skillet and immediately turn down the heat to medium-high. Cook for 4 minutes. Turn steaks, add 1 tablespoon butter (or more as desired) and thyme sprigs to the pan, and cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes, depending on your taste. Remove steaks from skillet and let rest, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make pan sauce: remove skillet from heat. Quickly saute the garlic and shallot for 1 to 2 minutes in the skillet using residual heat. Return the skillet to medium-low heat and add beef broth. Bring to a boil and reduce for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Serve sauce over steaks.</li>
    </ol>
